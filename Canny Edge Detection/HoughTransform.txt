To find centers:
	1. find coordinates of endpoints of line
	2. use bresenham to increment value of every point on line
	3. find spaces in picture with high points (threshold)
	4. change those spaces to different colors
	5. output image
To find edges:
	1. go through every center
	2. go through every edge
	3. make a list of distances
	4. add 1 to the list index for the distance between the edge and the circle
	5. the distance with the most votes is the correct distance so all of those edges are the circle edges
	6. highlight all those circle edges
To find coins:
	1. find the 3 different radius ranges
	2. smallest is penny, medium is nickel, large is quarter
	3. add up cost
